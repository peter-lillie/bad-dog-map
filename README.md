# dog-incident-map
A webapp to mark the location, reason and picture of a dog incident for the safety and knowledge of other outdoor recreation users. 

## TODO

- [ ] Create reusable report componenet, where users can upvote, downvote and report or comment on mapped incidents.
- [ ] Report an incident button.
- [ ] Figure out how to protect the thunderfrost api key so I can use their map tiles.
- [x] Rename project from bad-dog-map to dog-incident-map to be less abrasive.
